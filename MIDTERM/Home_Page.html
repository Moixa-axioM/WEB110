				<h2> About Me: </h2>
				<img src="Ryan.jpg" alt="Picture of myself" class="image">
				<p>
				Hi! My name is Ryan Mills and I am currently enrolled in JCCC for my CSS degree. My goal at this time is to get educated enough to break into a new career field.
				I have high hopes for the future and have experience in many different fields. Currently I am also working part time as an overnight security guard for Gardaworld.
				Some of my favorite things to do are: Play video games, workout, Eat at tasty new resturants, and spend an inordinate amount of time watching online drama from afar.
				As you have probably guessed the image on this page is not actually me, It's AI generated based on me. My phone camera is currently broken and I can't actually find a 
				good enough picture of myself. Now I'm just filling space so this looks like it fits on the page well. I dont actually have anything saved from when I used to be a Graphic
				Designer about a decade ago, so I'm probably going to use some placeholder images in the portfolio sections, thanks for understanding...
				</p>
