				I currently work as an overnight Security Officer for GardaWorld. My position currently gives the job of securing some of the parking garages for City Hall
				in the Kansas City, Missouri area. Its usually not very eventful as my evenings consists mostly of talking with Control and making sure there is nobody sleeping,
				loitering, or doing anything illegal in the area. So far I have had a few somewhat dangerous encounters (mostly with people on drugs) but overall I have yet
				to have yet to be injured or needed to use actual force on anyone. I do actually like this job as I get to drive around the city at night which is fun.
