		<h2>The Mass Effect Universe!</h2>
		<h3>What is Mass Effect?</h3>
		<p>Mass Effect is a Sci-fi RPG video game released in 2008 by Bioware. Mass Effect was the start of an expansive universe which now spans into 4 mainline games, 2 spinoff games, books, tv shows, movies and hopefully many more in the future!<br><br>
		</p>
		<h3>The Setting Explained</h3>
		<p>
		The Mass Effect stories are set in the 22nd century. After discovering the first Mass Relay, located near Pluto, humanity would expand throughout the Milkyway galaxy . With this newly discovered technology, humanity
		joined and explored many other races and cultures in this vast universe. All congregated together at a single point, The Citadel, these races consider galactic politics on a larger scale.
		The Citadel and its current borders in the Milkyway are led by the council. The council consists of three - four major races. The Asari, The Turians, The Salarians, and then of course
		Humanity.<br><br> 
		</p>
		<h3>The Mainline Story</h3>
		<p>The Main events of the Mass Effect Universe are centered around a mysterious and vicious old mechanical race nicknamed "The Reapers". After every 50,000 years,
		these Machines come from "Dark Space" outside our galaxy to devour any civilization that has been deemed intelligent enough to create their own AI life. You play as
		Commander Shepard throughout the Main 3 games of this Trilogy in a fight to save the galaxy from these Reapers by making hard decisions that will effect the outcome of your game.
